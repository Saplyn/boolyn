## Introduction

Macros are a way to write code that writes other code. The term macro refers
to a family of features in Rust: declarative macros with `macro_rules!` and
three kinds of procedural macros:

- Custom `#[derive]` macros that specify code added with the derive attribute used on structs and enums
- Attribute-like macros that define custom attributes usable on any item
- Function-like macros that look like function calls but operate on the tokens specified as their argument
