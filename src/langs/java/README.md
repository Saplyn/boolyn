# Java

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that
is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

## Features

- Object-oriented
- Garbage-collected
- Statically typed
- Platform-independent by runtime
- Compiled and interpreted

## Sample Program (Hello World)

```java
// hello world in Java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```
