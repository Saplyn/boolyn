# Saplyn's Notebook

## "What is this?"

This is a notebook for me, Saplyn. It acts as a personal knowledge index and
cheatsheet. It's primarily intended for my own use.

## "What this isn't..."

- A comprehensive guide, tutorial, or documentation to anything;
- A complete registry or catalog of all things;
- An unopinionated or objective source of information;
- Or anything beyond a personal notebook.
