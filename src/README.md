# Saplyn's Notebook

## "What is this?"

This is a notebook for me, Saplyn. It acts as a personal knowledge index and
cheatsheet. It's primarily intended for my own use. I'm publishing it simply
because it makes it easier for me to access it when I'm away from my computer.

However, you may find it useful as well, and that's great! I'm happy to help.
Also, if you find any errors or inaccuracies, it's welcome to open an issue or
a pull request to correct it.

## "What this isn't..."

- A comprehensive guide, tutorial, or documentation to anything;
- A complete registry or catalog of all things;
- An unopinionated or objective source of information;
- Or anything beyond a personal notebook.
